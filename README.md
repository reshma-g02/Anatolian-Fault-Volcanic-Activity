# Anatolian-Fault-Volcanic-Activity
This research investigates the link between tectonic movements along the East Anatolian Fault and volcanic eruptions in Eastern Anatolia. By analyzing seismic data and eruption histories of volcanoes like Mount Nemrut, the study explores how crustal stress changes and fault-slip mechanisms can trigger magma injection and hydrothermal shifts.
